# Image Approximation

## Overview

This program attempts to approximate an image using geometry. This is still slightly work in progress (but it does work), so only rectangles have been supported as of now. Images also have to be manually selected in `+page.svelte` currently. These features should be added in the near future.

## Setup

Node.js is required to run the program. Upon cloning, install the dependencies by running the command:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, create and run a development build:

```bash
npm run dev
```
